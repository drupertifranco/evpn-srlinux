# Laboratorio de EVPN de Srlinux

## Introduccion

Ethernet Virtual Private Network (EVPN) is a standard technology in multi-tenant Data Centers (DCs) and provides a control plane framework for many functions.
In this tutorial we will configure a VXLAN based Layer 2 EVPN service3 in a tiny CLOS fabric and at the same get to know SR Linux better!

Fabric configuration - here we will configure the routing protocol in the underlay of a fabric to advertise the Virtual Tunnel Endpoints (VTEP) of the leaf switches.
EVPN configuration - this chapter is dedicated to the EVPN service configuration and validation.
